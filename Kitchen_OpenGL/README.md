# 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on 3D object integration and manipulation, using Blender for modeling and OpenGL for rendering. It combines artistic design and graphics programming to create an interactive, realistic scene. Features include:
✅ Directional and point lighting
✅ Shadows and reflections
✅ Wireframe and solid view modes
✅ Rain, fog, and lightning effects
✅ Animated wine pouring effect

The scene depicts a modern kitchen with detailed furniture, appliances, and interactive lighting effects, offering an immersive 3D experience.
